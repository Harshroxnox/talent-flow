TalentFlow is a modern, all-in-one hiring platform designed to streamline the recruitment process. It provides HR professionals with the tools to manage job openings, track candidates, and create custom skill assessments.

## Features

-   **Job Management**: Create, view, and manage job listings with ease.
-   **Candidate Tracking**: A Kanban board to visualize and manage the candidate pipeline for each job.
-   **Candidate Profiles**: View detailed profiles for each candidate.
-   **Dynamic Assessment Builder**: Construct custom assessments with various question types (multiple choice, text, file upload), conditional logic, and validation rules.
-   **HR Dashboard**: A central hub providing an overview of hiring activities.
-   **Mock API Integration**: Utilizes Mock Service Worker (`msw`) to simulate a backend, allowing for a full-fledged frontend experience without a live server.
-   **Client-Side State Management**: Uses `zustand` for global state and `@tanstack/react-query` for server state management and caching.
-   **Local Persistence**: Leverages `IndexedDB` for persisting data locally in the browser.

##  Tech Stack

##  Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18.x or higher recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Harshroxnox/talent-flow.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd talent-flow
    ```
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at http://localhost:5173.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
The project follows a feature-based structure to keep the codebase organized and scalable.


```sh
/src
â”œâ”€â”€ api/         # Functions for fetching data (interacts with MSW)
â”œâ”€â”€ app/         # Core app setup (React Query client, DB, MSW)
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/      # Static assets like images and SVGs
â”œâ”€â”€ components/  # Reusable UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/       # Custom React hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/       # Top-level page components for each route
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/      # Global styles
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/       # Utility functions
â””â”€â”€ main.jsx     # App entry point
```
## Future Aspects

While TalentFlow is currently a robust client-side application, there are several exciting features planned for the future:

-   **Full Backend Integration**: Replace the mock API with a real backend service (e.g., Node.js, Express, and a database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB) to support multiple users and persistent data storage.
-   **User Authentication**: Implement a complete authentication system with user roles (Admin, HR Manager) to manage access control.
-   **Real-time Updates**: Integrate WebSockets to provide real-time updates, such as instant changes on the candidate Kanban board.
-   **Automated Email Notifications**: Set up automated emails to candidates when their application status changes.
-   **Advanced Analytics**: Enhance the HR dashboard with more detailed analytics, such as time-to-hire and candidate source tracking.
-   **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy the application to a cloud platform like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS for public access.
